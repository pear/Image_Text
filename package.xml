                          more test.</description>

      <notes>Summary:
                          --------
              
                          * Great speed improvements.
                          * Completely rewriten.
              
                          This release is a complete rewrite of the Image_Text package and therefor gives no cent on
                          API BC issues. The Image_Text_Line class has been dropped completely for performance reasons.
                          Thanks to the support of Pierre Alan Joye (pajoye@php.net)! The dependency to Image_Tools (which 
                          will be the next for a rewrite) has been dropped, too.</notes>

      <notes>Image_Text experienced extensive debugging and fixing, as well as small adjustments. The standard value
                          for line_spacing changed to 0.5 but this does not matter for the standard output, since the calculation
                          has changed.
              
                          The behavior of setColor() and setColors() has changed a bit to allow a new color format which defines
                          RGB values through an array keyed with 0, 1 and 2 plus optionally 3 as the alpha value.
              
                          This release should work quite fine, since it has been extensively debugged. But since I plan to make some
                          more improvements I can not promise a 100% stable API. The API should be fixed for about 95% now.</notes>
