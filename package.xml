  <summary>Image_Text - Advanced text maipulations in images</summary>
  <description>Image_Text enables you to deal more comfortable with texts inside GD 2 based images.
		                    Create text boxes inside your images, rotate them and let the class align your text
		                    inside it in horizontal and vertical directions. Image_Text can although determine
		                    the best font-size for a given text box.</description>

    <date>2004-02-20</date>
    <license>PHP License</license>
    <state>alpha</state>
    <notes>Image_Text experienced extensive debugging and fixing, as well as small adjustments. The standard value
                          for line_spacing changed to 0.5 but this does not matter for the standard output, since the calculation
                          has changed.
              
                          The behavior of setColor() and setColors() has changed a bit to allow a new color format which defines
                          RGB values through an array keyed with 0, 1 and 2 plus optionally 3 as the alpha value.
              
                          This release should work quite fine, since it has been extensively debugged. But since I plan to make some
                          more improvements I can not promise a 100% stable API. The API should be fixed for about 95% now.</notes>

      <notes>Summary:
                          --------
              
                          * Great speed improvements.
                          * Completely rewriten.
              
                          This release is a complete rewrite of the Image_Text package and therefor gives no cent on
                          API BC issues. The Image_Text_Line class has been dropped completely for performance reasons.
                          Thanks to the support of Pierre Alan Joye (pajoye@php.net)! The dependency to Image_Tools (which 
                          will be the next for a rewrite) has been dropped, too.</notes>
