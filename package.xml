  <summary>Image_Text - Advanced text maipulations in images</summary>
  <description>Image_Text enables you to deal more comfortable with texts inside GD 2 based images.
		                    Create text boxes inside your images, rotate them and let the class align your text
		                    inside it in horizontal and vertical directions. Image_Text can although determine
		                    the best font-size for a given text box.</description>

    <notes>Summary:
                          --------
              
                          * Great speed improvements.
                          * Completely rewriten.
              
                          This release is a complete rewrite of the Image_Text package and therefor gives no cent on
                          API BC issues. The Image_Text_Line class has been dropped completely for performance reasons.
                          Thanks to the support of Pierre Alan Joye (pajoye@php.net)! The dependency to Image_Tools (which 
                          will be the next for a rewrite) has been dropped, too.</notes>
